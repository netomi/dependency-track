**Fixes:**

**Upgrade Notes:**

* The API server now requires Java 21 or newer. Users deploying Dependency-Track via containers
don't have to do anything, since those have been shipped with Java 21 since version 4.10.0.
Users deploying Dependency-Track as JAR will need to upgrade their Java installation accordingly.
* The `/api/swagger.json` endpoint no longer exists. The REST API documentation is now available
at `/api/openapi.json` and `/api/openapi.yaml` respectively. The documentation format follows
the OpenAPI v3 specification, the Swagger v2 format is no longer provided.
* The `/api/v1/tag/{policyUuid}` REST API endpoint has been deprecated in favor of
`/api/v1/tag/policy/{uuid}`. Users relying on the outdated endpoint for their custom integrations
are encouraged to migrate to the new endpoint.
